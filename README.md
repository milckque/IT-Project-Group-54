# How to Run the Project

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed (recommended version: v22.18.0).  
  [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
This requires access to the GitHub repository. If cloning is not possible, you can also download the ZIP file of the repository and extract it.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/milckque/IT-Project-Group-54.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**
```sh
cd /purchase-partners
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```sh
npm install
```
*(Run this only the first time or whenever dependencies change.)*

4. **Start the development server**
```sh
npm run dev
```
- This will start the app locally.
- The terminal will display a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`)-open this in your browser to view the app.
